# Geometry Dash 1.9 Private Server

This is essentially an emulator for Geometry Dash 1.9 server. I know people have made these before but I figured I would try making one for GD 1.9. Feel free to report bugs if you want to. I will try my best to fix them.

*Please note that this server is only compatible with GD 1.9 and will not work on any other version*

## Future Plans

The server software right now is in early beta. I still have many more plans for it later on!! Some of those plans are:

* More customization options
* Better looking dashboard
* Port over exploitPatch.php
* Proper roles system
* Cron job
* Automod
* New webhooks

  ## Known issues

  * Global leaderboard does not work
  * Weekly leaderboard does not work
  * Level copying does not work
 
  *These will all be fixed in a future release*

If you would like to contribute to this server, feel free to make a pull request with your changes.
